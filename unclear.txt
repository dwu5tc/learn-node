review: regular and arrow functions, this keyword
look into: passport
look into: helpers
look into: data sanitization (storeschema pre save) and XSS attacks
look into: how blingjs works and queryselector/(all)
why: we use form for the heart
why/fix: registering with nonunqiue email gives error that is not redirect back + flash
why: cant confirm passwords on the frontend (authcontroller.confirmedpasswords)
